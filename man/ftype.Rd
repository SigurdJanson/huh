\description{
This function figures out whether the input function is a
regular/primitive/internal function, a internal/S3/S4 generic, or a
S3/S4/RC method.
}
\note{
This is function is slightly simplified as it's possible
for a method from one class to be a generic for another class, but that
seems like such a bad idea that hopefully no one has done it.

This function has been taken from \verb{[sloop](https://github.com/r-lib/sloop)::}
\code{ftype} and optimised (by reducing dependencies and instantiating objects only when needed).
Unlike the version from roxygen2 this function does not distinguish internal and primitive
generics as I do not see what value that has for users (except may curiosity).
