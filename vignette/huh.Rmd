## What It Does

R objects can be ... "shady". There is a large variety of objects. Though they may look similar the difference can make their handling quite difficult.

The "huh?" package wants to describe objects to make it easier to understand what they contain and how to handle them.



## HUH?


```{r huh1, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
huh(1:3)
xy <- matrix(1:4, 2)
huh(xy)
huh(mean)
```

<!-- `huh` distinguishes different OOP paradigms with the field `paradigm`. -->
